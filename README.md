# SRT-to-CSV-and-audio-split

To be able to train DeepSpeech, audio-files should not be longer than 10s.
Therefore, this repo offers the possibility to easily splice audio files and prepare corresponding transcript files.

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
* [librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/)
* [SoundFile](https://pypi.org/project/SoundFile/)
* [pydub](https://pypi.org/project/pydub/)
* [moviepy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/)

FYI: the script "convert_srt_to_csv.py" is meant to be used on srt files with encoding "cp1252" (a.k.a Windows 1252). The reason for this is that in order to keep characters such as "Ã¤", the files have to be encoded to "utf8"


## Walk-through

<b>This section will explain what the modules and script do in order to provide a deeper understanding of the individual steps and facilitate modification</b>

<b>First:</b> Create a folder called "srt_files" where you store your srt_files and a folder "audio" where you store your audio-files (wmv or mp4).
