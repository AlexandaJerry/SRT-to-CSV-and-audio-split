# SRT-to-CSV-and-audio-split
Split long audio files based on subtitle-info in SRT File (Transcript saved in CSV)


FYI: the script "convert_srt_to_csv.py" is meant to be used on srt files with encoding "cp1252" (a.k.a Windows 1252). The reason for this is that in order to keep characters such as "Ã¤", the files have to be encoded to "utf8"

First: create a folder called "srt_files" where you store your srt_files.
